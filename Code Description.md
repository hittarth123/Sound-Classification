This Python script is designed for audio classification tasks using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Below is a breakdown of each section:

### Data Preparation:
1. **Import Libraries**: Import necessary libraries including `os`, `librosa`, `numpy`, `StratifiedKFold` from `sklearn.model_selection`, `Sequential`, `Conv2D`, `MaxPooling2D`, `Flatten`, `Dense`, `Dropout` from `tensorflow.keras.layers`, `to_categorical`, and `plot_model` from `tensorflow.keras.utils`.
2. **Define Paths and Parameters**: Set the base directory path to the audio dataset, number of cross-validation folds, input shape for the CNN model, batch size, and number of epochs.
3. **Load Audio Data**: Use `librosa` to load audio files, extract Mel spectrogram features, and prepare labels for classification.

### Feature Extraction:
1. **Extract Features**: Define a function `extract_features` to extract Mel spectrogram features from audio files using `librosa`.
2. **Precompute Features**: Precompute and store Mel spectrogram features for all audio files in the dataset.

### Model Definition and Training:
1. **Define CNN Model**: Define a function `create_cnn_model` to create a CNN model for classification using `Sequential` from `tensorflow.keras`.
2. **Cross-Validation**: Perform k-fold cross-validation using `StratifiedKFold` to split the data into training and testing sets for each fold.
3. **Train and Evaluate Model**: Train and evaluate the CNN model on each fold of the cross-validation, collecting test accuracy for each fold.
4. **Average Accuracy**: Calculate and print the average accuracy and standard deviation across all folds.

### Explanation:
- The script first prepares the dataset by extracting Mel spectrogram features from audio files.
- The script then obtains the output classes (all 10 of them) from the metadata file.
- It then defines a CNN model for classification and trains it using k-fold cross-validation.
- The average accuracy across all folds is calculated and printed.
- The `plot_model` function is used to visualize the architecture of the CNN model and save it as an image file (`cnn_model.png`).

This script provides a framework for audio classification tasks and can be adapted for different datasets and model architectures.
